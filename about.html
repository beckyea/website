        <p> Hi! My name is Becky and I am a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Mechanical Engineering & Applied Mechanics and minoring in Computer & Information Science. I'm interested in user experience and user-driven design, and have experience in mechanical design, user interface, and graphics. </p>

        <p>My engineering story begins in middle school, when my parents and I put together a Wordpress site for my Bat Mitzvah. At one point, I decided that I didn't like its aesthetics, so I figured out how to locally edit the html and then sent the new file to my father to re-upload. In the years that followed, I continued to find ways to combine engineering, code, and design. My sophomore year of high school, I wrote teentheatreviews, a website to serve as a Yelp for theater reviews but gave up the domain after it didn't gain traction. I joined my high school's robotics team, where I completely re-did our web presence as Website Lead (junior and senior years) as well as serving as Pit Design Lead and Inventory Lead (senior year) while being an active member of the Build and Operations Teams. I also put a robotics-related application on the iOS App Store during my senior year. I also found my interest in design during my tenure as Sports Section Editor for my high school's yearbook during my junior and senior years.</p>

         <p>At Penn, I do layout for the food magazine, Penn Appetit, and am a TA for the second semester introductory computer science course, CIS 120. During this past semester, I served as the Webmaster for our branch of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and was on the board of the Pennvention Committee. I created an Android application for the Penn Working Dog Center with three peers as part of a CIS 350 project, and have been working on a potluck coordinating website, Food&Franz with two friends both during and outside of the past two PennApps competitions. I also created the Snapchat geofilter for one of the engineering buildings on Penn campus.</p>

         <p>Those who know me would say that I am a "people person." I love being around people, talking, and hanging out. I have been on the board of my sorority, Alpha Omega Epsilon, every semester since my initiation, including serving as social chair this past semester. In my free time, I enjoy following the San Francisco Giants and Golden State Warriors, traveling, adventuring, running, playing with my dog, and sleeping.</p>
