            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>I'm a Robotics Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania and am excited about software for electro-mechanical systems, especially robotic motion. I have a diverse and broad background spanning the breadth of both mechancial engineering and software development. I have academic experience in Mechatronic Design, RTOS and Embedded Software, Controls, Kinematics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision in addition to software and mechanical fundamentals, as well as professional experience on large corporate development, small-team industrial robotic hardware and software, and user-focused design.</p>

            <p>I started dabbling in tech in late middle/early high school but never finishing projects. I tried both hardware and software in high school; I joined the FIRST Robotics teams' mechanical subteam and ran the team's website, then developed an iOS app and put it on the App Store. I went off to college declared Mechanical Engineering, excited about design and disallusioned about software. I joined a freshman residental program of mostly CS majors and blindly followed them into the CS Intro sequence (which I ended up TAing for 6 semesters). The following summer, I took a design internship at Autodesk and was surprised to find myself aching to write scripts for the software rather than use it. When I returned to Penn, I decided that I loved the Mechanical Engineering community and project-based courses enough to stay in the major and would instead tack on a CS minor and overload extra CS classes on the side. I studied abroad summer after sophomore year, and decided to try my hands at pure software the summer after junior year, taking an SDE internship at Amazon. I quickly discovered that I find pure software exciting but not fulfilling, and the most fulfilling work I had done was writing code for the assignments in the Intro to Mechatronics course. I thus decided that I wanted to become a roboticist, and have yet to look back. I was a Robotics Intern at X (formerly Google X) this past summer, and loved it.</p>

             <p>Those who know me would say that I am a "people person." I am happiest when I'm with my friends, and I was on the board of my sorority, Alpha Omega Epsilon, for the majority of my college career, including seriving as social chair, recruitment chair, and membership education director. In my free time, I enjoy following the San Francisco Giants and Golden State Warriors, traveling, hiking and adventuring outdoors, running, and playing with my dog.</p>
